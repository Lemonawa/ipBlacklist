# ipBlacklist
This repository is solely collecting proxy IPs so that they can be indiscriminately blocked using a WAF to prevent attackers from abusing these IPs.

You're welcome to PR any proxy lists you find. An upload.py is available for automatic Cloudflare blocking.

To see the current sources we're crawling from, refer to the sources section in config.yaml.
